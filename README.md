# saltydb
This is a small application using Cordova/Ionic2 and the Steam Web API.

1. Install the latest version of Node.js
2. In a command window, execute `npm install -g ionic cordova`
3. Download the SaltyDB files from Github. Open a command window in the root of the project and run `npm install`
4. Begin editing in your favorite code editor. To run the app in a browser use the command `ionic serve`

NOTES:
While running the app in a browser you can make changes to files and the package will rebuild automatically.

In order for the Steam Web API to work while using `ionic serve` you need this Chrome extension:
  `https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog`
  
In Firefox this may be unnecessary. If nothing shows up when you serve the app check the browser debug.
